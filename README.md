# About
The purpose of this project was to bring back 15-years-old memories. I once made a game for some contest which included so called "clicker" games - games made in `The Games Factory` (currently under brand of `Multimedia Fusion` (https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5))

I was strongly inspired by [@mhagmajer](https://twitter.com/mhagmajer) and his Lighting talk during [WarsawJS](https://warsawjs.com) to write this one in React.

# About the Game
You are a kind of policeman with bucket filled with water. Bad guy (prisoner) wants to escape - thus he is dropping bombs in order to destroy the wall. Are you REACTive enough to stop him?

# How to play
Game does not support mobile yet - mouse only. Game consists of 6 levels, starting very slowly but becoming desperate later on.
You can catch bonus (double score) to prove others you are better than them. No more bonuses yet :(
